# 🚀 AIEE - Academy of Information,Education and Entrepreneurship
AIEE is a high-performance, responsive landing page for the AIEE Facebook community. It serves as a professional gateway for career resources and educational networking.

## 💀 The Philosophy
Let’s get one thing straight: I am not a web developer. I find the modern web ecosystem to be a bloated disaster. My focus is on real engineering **Android, Windows desktop, AI/Machine Learning, and Unity GameDev.**

I have zero passion for the "web" and even less for **JavaScript**. JS is a mess I refuse to touch unless it’s a "learn or die" scenario. This project exists to prove that you can build a functional, responsive interface using nothing but **pure HTML and CSS**. If logic is required in the future, it will be handled by **C# and ASP.NET** on the backend.

**I don't do "scripts." I do systems. F*ck JS.**
